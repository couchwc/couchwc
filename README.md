Hey! Welcome to my page. 
I'm Cody. I'm a .NET Developer. I started my career developing windows forms apps, then got into WPF. I'm currently getting introduced to web development. 

I'm currently learning Blazor. Also, I'm looking to learn more about other .NET technologies like the Entity Framework.
